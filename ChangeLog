Change Log Entry - Exclusion of Animals and Penn from Game
Change description:
The originally proposed design for the farming game included Animals, which were intended to be placed into Penns. However, these features were ommitted from the final game.

Justification:
Due to time constraints during the development phase, we chose to prioritize gameplay functionality and to overall polish the game.
Additionally, reflecting on the plan, we found that the animals and their associated penn classes would simply be providing redundant functionality, as their behavior was near identical to plants and farmplots.
To avoid simply duplicating and adding redundancy to the game, these features were decided to be ommitted from the final game.
